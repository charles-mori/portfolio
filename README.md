📖 Solution Approach
HTML Structure:

CSS Styling:
Basic styling was handled through a custom CSS file.
We leveraged Bootstrap classes for faster grid layouts, spacing, and responsive design.

Responsiveness:
Bootstrap’s grid system was used to ensure the website is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

We collaborated using GitHub, keeping our commits clean and making sure everyone's contributions were reflected.
